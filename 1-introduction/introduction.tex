\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
The following sections provide the essential background of the concepts and applications of the experimental and computational work contained within this thesis. While it is indeed sufficiently thorough, the author provides for convenience, his published review on the modulation of the porosity of carbons for uptake of various gases (\ref{pub:review}) as appendix \ref{ap:review}. This provides much broader information of the synthesis of porous carbons outside of just the \glspl{turbostratic carbon} which are examined in this work, and the measurement of porosity, as well as the relationship between porosity and uptake of different sorbents. 
%\ref{pub:review} gives a detailed overview of many of the concepts and literature necessary to understand the experimentation and results described in later chapters - thus it makes up the bulk of this introductory chapter. In fact, sections discussing \acrfullpl{ztc} and \ce{H2} and \ce{CH4} storage are outside the scope of the practical parts of this work, but give some insight into the broader field of porous materials, adsorption, and small molecule capture/storage. Nonetheless there was some important detail which was not included in the publication, thus sections \ref{s:ccs} and \ref{s:adsorption_porosity} are included to discuss \ce{CO2} capture, and the general theories of adsorption and porosity, respectively.

\section{Synthesis of turbostratic carbons}

\subsection{From Cigarette Butts}

\acrfullpl{ucb} pose a large environmental hazard as a result of (i) being made of non-biodegradable \acrfull{ca} as well as (ii) containing a myriad of toxic chemicals.\citep{Slaughter2011, Puls2011, chevalier2018nano} As they are the most common waste material worldwide, there have been attempts to reduce their environmental presence, initially \textit{via} anti-littering campaigns.\citep{Prevention2011, Harris2011} More promising however is the prospect of valorising \acrshortpl{ucb} by various means, including conversion to activated carbons as reported by the author in \ref{pub:CB} as well as many other researchers.\citep{Soltani, Soltani2013, lima2018, xiong2019nitrogen, Lee2014, Hamzah2017, Yu2018, Wang2016a, Koochaki2019, Bilge2019}

    \caption{Structure of cellulose acetate.}
    \label{fig:cellulose acetate}
\end{figure}

\begin{sloppypar}
The reported porosity of carbons derived from \acrshortpl{ucb} is highly varied depending on synthetic conditions. In the absence of an \gls{activating agent}, and without pre-carbonisation steps, $A_{BET}$ typically does not exceed \qty{700}{\metre\squared\per\gram}.\citep{Koochaki2019, Soltani2013, Yazdi2012, Lee2014, Hamzah2017} Whereas using a \gls{porogen}, and/or pre-carbonising in air or hydothermally can improve surface areas to around \qty{3000}{\metre\squared\per\gram}.\citep{Xiong2018a, Koochaki2019, Sun2017, Bilge2019} The author's reports of ultrahigh porosity from KOH-activated hydrothermally carbonised \acrshortpl{ucb} in \ref{pub:CB} ($A_{BET}$ \qty{>4000}{\metre\squared\per\gram}, pore volume \qty{>2.00}{\cm\cubed\per\gram}) and high degree of microporosity (\qty{>90}{\percent}) are partially corroborated by the similar results using pure \acrfull{ca} in \ref{pub:CA}, suggesting that \acrshort{ca} is an ideal precursor for activation to yield high surface area carbons. Xiong \textit{et al.} also report a nitrogen-doped \acrshort{ucb}-derived activated carbon with hierarchical porosity and $A_{BET}$ of \qty{3420}{\metre\squared\per\gram}, though this result is dubious as (i) the \ce{N2} isotherm does not include ultralow pressure data, (ii) freespace appears to be incorrectly measured and (iii) isotherm measurement is not described in the text.\citep{xiong2019nitrogen} It was suggested in \ref{pub:CB} that the unusually high porosity of \acrshort{ucb}-derived carbons may be contributed to by the action of so-called contaminant-\glspl{porogen}, i.e. trace elements found in cigarette butts that can act as \glspl{activating agent} because carbons from \acrshortpl{ucb} had greater porosity than unused, i.e. `fresh' \acrshortpl{cb}. However, another factor may be the specific treatment of the \acrshortpl{ucb} prior to any carbonisation - that is the removal of any paper, residual ash and tobacco.
\end{sloppypar}

The trace element composition of \acrshortpl{ucb} have been studied by various means, including neutron activation analysis of the intact butts,\citep{iskander1992multielement, Iskander1985, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997} \gls{adsorption} and emission spectroscopy of various aqueous extracts,\citep{MussaloRauhamaa1986, Kazi2009, Moriwaki2009, Moerman2011, Pelit2013, Dobaradaran2018} voltammetry experiments,\citep{Nitsch1991, Kalcher1993} as well as mixed methods according to environmental contaminant quantification standards.\citep{cardoso2018exposure} The reported concentration has a great degree of variability depending on collection site, method, and brand. For example, work by Iskander \textit{et al.} indicates that \ce{Al} can be present in concentrations as low as \num{59}, and as high as \qty{2200}{\micro\gram\per\gram}, depending on the country of origin of the smoked cigarette butt. Similarly, \acrshort{ucb} samples collected from the environment\citep{Dobaradaran2017, Moriwaki2009, Moerman2011, chevalier2018nano} may have lower quantities of some elements due to leaching, but simultaneously may absorb some elements from the environment (for example from sea water). Trace elements have been identified in \acrshortpl{ucb} from almost every region of the periodic table, including alkali and alkaline earth metals;\cite{MussaloRauhamaa1986, Iskander1985, iskander1992multielement, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997, cardoso2018exposure}  transition metals, post transition metals and metalloids;\citep{MussaloRauhamaa1986, Dobaradaran2017, Iskander1985, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997, Moriwaki2009, Moerman2011, Pelit2013, Dobaradaran2018, Ren2017, cardoso2018exposure, chevalier2018nano} lanthanides;\citep{iskander1992multielement} and halogens.\citep{Iskander1985, iskander1992multielement, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997} Cigarette butt derived carbons have been also been found to contain various metals in trace quantities,\citep{Soltani, Soltani2013, Yazdi2012} although \ce{Ti}, \ce{K}, and \ce{Na} have also been reported at quantities above \qty{1}{\wtpercent}.\citep{Soltani, Soltani2013, Yazdi2012, lima2018, Lee2014} In addition the presence of \ce{Ca}, \ce{K}, \ce{Mg}, \ce{Na}, and \ce{Al} were identified in \acrshort{ucb}-derived \gls{hydrochar} reported in \ref{pub:CB}.

\subsection{Impregnation Methods}

Most commonly in the synthesis of activated carbons \glspl{porogen} are added to precursors by physical mixing - i.e. some combination of grinding and stirring - with the precursor.\citep{Aljumialy2020Porous, Blankenship2017Cigarette, Altwala2020Predictable, Sevilla2016Highly} As mentioned in \textbf{section 4.1.1.} of \ref{pub:review} an alternative technique is to impregnate the precursor with a (typically aqeuous) solution of \gls{porogen}.\citep{Botome2017Preparation, Ge2019Highly, Adlak2021Physicochemical, Shi2021Copper, Han2021Mulch} While there is scant evidence that solution impregnation has better outcomes over physical mixing in terms of porosity development, the rationale of the former technique is that the \gls{activating agent} will be more evenly distributed throughout the precursor thus providing more homogenous porosity in the product however there is as yet no study to support this. 

A further method using oxidative chemical activation is so-called organic salt carbonisation (again, see \ref{pub:review} \textbf{section 4.4.1.}) wherein the metal cation of an organic salt activates the carbonised precursor on pyrolysis. Reports, in particular from Sevilla \textit{et al.} show that this method allows for a high degree of tunability in carbon PSDs by changing the identity of the activating cation.\citep{Sevilla2013general, Tsumura2014Structure, Ferrero2015Mesoporous, Ferrero2016Efficient, Fuertes2015Hierarchical, Roberts2015Hierarchically, Yadav20123D, Yang2018Spontaneous} The majority of anions used in organic salt carbonisation are small molecules such as gluconate or citrate,\citep{Sevilla2013general, Yang2017Template, Sevilla2014Direct, Tsumura2014Structure, Ferrero2015Mesoporous, Ferrero2016Efficient, Fuertes2015Hierarchical, Yang2020Production, Fuertes2014One} however polymers have also been employed.\citep{Puthusseri20143D, Roberts2015Hierarchically, Yadav20123D, Hines2004Surface} 

The philosophy of these two emergent techniques (solution impregnation and organic salt carbonisation) for porogen-precursor mixing is that (i) the process can be simplified, (ii) porosity can be more readily controlled, and (iii) porosity is more homogeneous throughout the product. These effects are supposedly a result of both improved \gls{porogen}-precursor contact, and more homogeneous \gls{porogen} distribution. For the purposes of this chapter, mixing techniques with such goals are collectively termed `impregnation' methods. In terms of solution impregnation, thus far syntheses have only been reported wherein the precursor is mixed with the \gls{porogen} directly prior to pyrolysis.\citep{Botome2017Preparation, Ge2019Highly, Adlak2021Physicochemical, Shi2021Copper, Han2021Mulch, Boujibar2018CO2} That is, it has not been attempted to impregnate the \gls{porogen} at the \gls{htc} step. As such, herein the combined \gls{htc} and impregnation of \ce{KOH} on sawdust is examined. This technique is also inspired by the observation made by Zhang \textit{et al.} that the formation of \ce{K} salts with oxygen-rich moieties on the surface of calcined glucose is associated with improvements in ultramicroporosity.\citep{Zhang2019situ} \acrfull{sd} was chosen due to the high quantity of literature surrounding carbons derived from the activation of hydrothermally carbonised sawdust,\citep{Balahmar2019Pre, Aljumialy2020Porous, Cox2017Ultra, Balahmar2015Generalized} making for easy comparison between the results of the technique studied in this chapter and more established techniques.

    \caption{Structure of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. \Acrfull{ds} is taken as the average number of sodium carboxymethyl groups (\ce{-CH2COONa}) per monomer.}
    \label{fig:nc_structure}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, while the porosity of carbons derived through organic salt carbonisation has been exploited through changing the cation,\citep{Sevilla2013general, Tsumura2014Structure, Ferrero2015Mesoporous, Ferrero2016Efficient, Fuertes2015Hierarchical, Roberts2015Hierarchically, Yadav20123D, Yang2018Spontaneous} the capacity for greater more precise control over porosity by changing the degree of substitution of a cation on a polymer chain has not yet been explored. In studies using physical mixing, the \gls{porogen}:precursor weight ratio is typically reported.\citep{Altwala2020Predictable, Adeniran2015Compactivation, Blankenship2017Cigarette, Sevilla2016green, Ludwinowicz2015Potassium, Deng2015Inspired, Alhamed2015Preparation, Hu2003simple} As discussed in \ref{pub:review}, \textbf{section 2.1.2.} oxidative chemical activation primarily relies on redox reactions between \ce{C} and the \gls{porogen}, thus knowing the exact stoichiometric  \gls{porogen}:\ce{C} ratio may provide a route to understanding the precise effects of \gls{porogen} concentration on carbon porosity requires information as to the composition of the precursor. To this end, this study also investigates \acrfull{nc} (structure shown in figure \ref{fig:nc_structure}) as a precursor to activated carbon. The \gls{porogen} in this case is the sodium carboxymethyl group, and the \gls{porogen}:precursor ratio is controlled by the \acrfull{ds}.

\section{Physisorption \& porosity}
\label{s:adsorption_porosity}
Porous materials possess an interconnected pore system where pores are defined as voids which are deeper than they are wide.\citep{mcnaught1997compendium, Thommes2015Physisorption} Additionally, pores are defined as being able to contain fluid, which indirectly gives a minimum width for voids to be considered pores of \qty{2.6}{\angstrom}, as this is the kinetic diameter of the smallest practical fluid specie, \ce{He}.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption, Lide2007Handbook} The ability of porous materials to contain fluids has led to the use of the phenomenon of adsorption being used to characterise their porosity. That is, knowledge of the behaviour of the system when the material is enriched with a fluid is utilised to understand pore size, shape and interconnectivity. In particular, so-called \gls{physisorption} is exploited wherein \gls{adsorbate}-\gls{adsorbent} interactions do not include any sort of chemical attraction but instead rely on non-bonding forces\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption} - thus hypothetically, structure ought not be significantly conflated with surface chemistry. What follows is a discussion of the various types of pore structures and associated adsorption phenomena. More specifics on the derivations of porosity from \gls{physisorption} isotherms is available in \ref{pub:review}, \textbf{section 3.4.2.} as well as section \ref{ss:porosimetry}.


\subsection{Pore characteristics and filling mechanisms}
\label{ss:pore_filling}

The \acrfull{iupac} defines ranges of pore sizes according to the mechanisms of pore filling by an \gls{adsorbate}.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption} The three main mechanisms; \gls{micropore} filing; monolayer adsorption; and multilayer adsorption are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:filling}. Specifically, \glspl{micropore} (\qty{<20}{\angstrom})\citep{mcnaught1997compendium} are filled at ultralow relative pressures, and are characterised by strong heats of adsorption due to complementary \gls{adsorbate}-\gls{adsorbent} interactions from all pore walls.\citep{dubinin1989fundamentals} The subdivision into \glspl{ultramicropore} (\qty{<7}{\angstrom}) and \glspl{supermicropore} (\qtyrange[range-units=single]{7}{20}{\angstrom})\citep{mcnaught1997compendium} is derived from the fact that pores narrower than \qty{7}{\angstrom} can fit two adjacent rows of \ce{N2} molecules,\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption} and thus have the highest degree of pore wall potential overlap. \Glspl{mesopore} (\qtyrange[range-units=single]{20}{500}{\angstrom})\citep{mcnaught1997compendium} are characterised by being large enough to allow monolayer adsorption. That is, all adsorbed molecules are in contact with the surface and are not significantly influenced by attraction to an opposing pore wall.\citep{gregg1967adsorption, yang1997gas} As pressure increases, repulsive \gls{adsorbate}-\gls{adsorbate} interactions are overcome so that additional \gls{adsorbate} molecules adsorb on top of the monolayer - this process is known as multilayer adsorption. The widest pore size classification is \glspl{macropore} which are larger than 500 \unit{\angstrom}\citep{mcnaught1997compendium} and are not easily characterised by isothermal gas adsorption experiments, instead necessitating the use of mercury intrusion porosimetry for determination of porosity.\citep{abell1999mercury, gregg1967adsorption, haynes1973pore} In addition to these principal adsorption processes, in \glspl{mesopore} capillary condensation can occur at relative pressures greater than \num{\sim0.2} wherein the adsorbate enters a liquid-like state despite being below saturation pressure. This can lead to hysteresis in the resultant isotherm which is discussed in more depth in section \ref{ss:iso_interpretation}.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption, monson2012understanding}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, keepaspectratio]{1-introduction/figs/pore_filling.png}
    \caption{The three principle pore filling mechanisms, in order of their occurence with increasing relative pressure; (a) micropore filling; (b) completion of the monlayer in mesopores; and (c) multilayer adsorption.}
    \label{fig:filling}
\end{figure}

While few materials show uniform pore shape, idealised shape is defined by \acrshort{iupac} according to five characteristic shapes; cylindrical, slit, funnel, sphere, and ink-bottle.\citep{rouquerol1994recommendations, kaneko1994determination, zdravkov2007pore} For example while aluminium oxides typically have cylindrical pores,\citep{zdravkov2007pore} \glspl{turbostratic carbon} are usually assumed to have slit-shaped pores,\citep{Everett1976Adsorption, Jagiello20132D, Lastoskie1993} although carbide-derived carbons have been shown to possess cylindrical or spherical pores.\citep{kurig2016suitability} Zeolites have a broad range of pore shapes.\citep{park2002effect} 

\begin{figure}[b!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, keepaspectratio]{1-introduction/figs/pore_accessibility.png}
    \caption{The diferent types of pores classified according to their accessibility; (a) an open, through pore; (b) an open, blind pore; (c) external pores; (d) a chemically closed pore; and (e) a closed pore. The small blue dot indicates the probe molecule size.}
    \label{fig:pore_accessibility}
\end{figure}

In addition to shape and size, pores are also defined by their degree of accessibility. Figure \ref{fig:pore_accessibility} illustrates this type of pore classification. In general, pores can be termed as `closed' or `open', based on whether or not they have an accessible entrance. In the case of open pores, these are further subdivided into `through' pores wherein both ends of the pore are accessible, and `blind' pores wherein only one end of the pore is accessible. In addition, porosity can be formed through undulations on the surface, provided that the depth of these undulations is greater than the width. These are known as `external pores'. However open pores are not necessarily accessible to an adsorptive, that is there entrance may be smaller than the adsorptive molecule - these pores are termed as `chemically closed'. This can occur for ink-bottle pores with a narrow neck, or for very narrow slit or cylindrical pores.\citep{rouquerol1994recommendations, kaneko1994determination, zdravkov2007pore} Porosimetry is only able to quantify apparent porosity as defined by `true' open pores (i.e. not chemically closed) and indeed for gravimetric adsorption applications this is the the only kind of meaningful porosity. However, closed pores nonetheless contribute to a materials bulk density and thus can influence \textit{volumetric} uptake capacity for an adsorptive.


The final characteristic of porous structures is porosity hierarchy. Materials like \acrshortpl{mof} and zeolites typically possess uniform or unimodal porosity,\citep{WeitkampZeolites, Siriwardane2005Adsorption, Ding2019Carbon, lin2009hydrogen} whereas \glspl{turbostratic carbon} typically have multiple- or even a continuous range of (i.e. hierarchical) pore widths.\citep{Li2020Hierarchical, Sevilla2014Energy, Xia2008Hierarchical, Balahmar2017Biomass} The pore hierarchy or lack thereof can play an important role in which applications the material is best suited to - for example a uniform \acrfull{psd} can be used to exclude molecules of a certain size.\citep{qian2020mof, reid2001adsorption, Adeniran2014family}

\subsection{Isotherm classification and interpretation}
\label{ss:iso_interpretation}

The various adsorption behaviours of a porous material discussed in the previous section result in distinct and interpretable forms of the resultant isotherms. As a general rule, the relative amount of gas adsorpted in different pressure ranges gives an indication of the amount of porosity in the internal \gls{micropore} and \gls{mesopore} regions as well as the amount of external surface area. To demonstrate, a labelled isotherm is shown in figure \ref{fig:isotherm_anatomy}. High adsorption in the low pressure region indicates the presence of \glspl{micropore}, while an increase in uptake at pressures around the midpoint of the isotherm indicate mesoporosity. If there is a plateau in the middle of the isotherm, this typically indicates that a monolayer has formed. The curvature of the isotherm prior to the plateau (the adsorption `knee') is indicative of the breadth of the \acrshort{psd}; a gentle knee shows a broad \acrshort{psd}, while a sharp knee indicates that pore sizes are narrowly distributed. Finally, high uptake as relative pressure approaches 1 are indicative of adsorption on the external surface, showing that the material is non-porous or macroporous.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption} \acrshort{iupac} has designated eight distinct isotherm types.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption, Sing1985} These need not be discussed in full detail here - it is sufficient to state that types I(a) and (b) isotherms are indicative of microporosity, while IV(a), IV(b) and V are seen on isotherms with high mesoporosity. Nonporous samples typically exhibit type II, III or VI isotherms. The variation in shapes can be indicative of surface chemistry and/or pore size hierarchy.\citep{thommes2014physical, monson2012understanding} Of course as a lot of materials exhibit multiple types of porosity, many materials exhibit characteristics of multiple isotherm types.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption} 

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, keepaspectratio]{1-introduction/figs/isotherm_anatomy.png}
    \caption{An isotherm of \ce{N2} on a turbostratic carbon. The isotherm possesses (a) high uptake in the micropore region, indicating microporosity; (b) a sharp knee due to a narrow \acrshort{psd}; (c) a plateau in the medium pressure region due to formation of a monolayer this remains flat in the middle of the isotherm due to lack of mesoporosity; (d) high uptake as relative pressure approaches 1 showing external surface adsorption; and (e) a hysteresis loop due to capillary condensation.}
    \label{fig:isotherm_anatomy}
\end{figure}

Apart from the general isotherm types, the presence of hysteresis - i.e. desorption releasing less \gls{adsorbate} than is taken up during adsorption at an identical relative pressure - is indicative of capillary condensation (see section \ref{ss:pore_filling}.\citep{thommes2014physical, monson2012understanding, landers2013density} As with characteristic isotherm types, \acrshort{iupac} has defined six distinct forms of hysteresis loop. Depending on the type of hyteresis loop, its presence may indicate adsorption metastability in an `open' pore, pore network effects and/or other forms of pore blocking.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption} Each of the six hysteresis loops are associated with specific kinds of materials - for example H4 loops are frequently found in micro-mesoporous carbons, whereas H1 is typically associated with materials possessing uniform open mesopores.\citep{Thommes2015Physisorption, monson2012understanding}  

\subsection{Dual isotherm porosimetry}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\ce{CO2} capture}{CO2 capture}}
\label{s:ccs}

Methods for \ce{CO2} capture as an add-on to industrial processes can be divided into three principal, broad groups; (i) oxy-fuel combustion, (ii) pre-combustion capture and (iii) post-combustion capture.\citep{kanniche2010pre} Oxy-fuel combustion is not a true \ce{CO2} capture method, but provides a means to more facile \ce{CO2} capture by producing a highly pure stream of \ce{CO2} meaning that gas separation is not necessary priory to capture.\citep{stanger2015oxyfuel, wall2009overview} Pre-combustion capture on the other hand involves the gasification of the fuel source using steam and oxygen, forming a mixture of \ce{H2} and \ce{CO} which is known as syngas. The \ce{H2} can be used as a fuel, while in a similar manner to oxy-fuel combustion, the \ce{CO} is converted to pure \ce{CO2} for ease of capture.\citep{jansen2015pre} Post-combustion capture does not require any of these complex treatments - \ce{CO2} is simply separated and captured from existing flue streams.\citep{wang2017review, samanta2012post} Thus, this method may be considered the the most versatile of the three.

As stated in \ref{pub:review}, \textbf{section 1} the principal commercial mode of post-combustion \ce{CO2} capture is \textit{via} chemical capture using liquid amines. This process is plagued by high costs due to the degradation of the amine solvent as well as corrosion of equipment.\citep{aronu2009solvent, dutcher2015amine, delgado2018degradation} Membrane-based \ce{CO2} capture and separation doesn't rely on chemical regeneration as the requisite membrane material simply selectively allows \ce{CO2} to travel through it while excluding other molecules due to their size.\citep{adewole2013current, ramasubramanian2011recent} The (theoretically) pure stream of \ce{CO2} is then captured at the other side. In order for this to work, high pressures must be use to force \ce{CO2} through the membrane; this can often lead to membrane degradation.\citep{powell2006polymeric} As a result of these problems, a third category of \ce{CO2} capture materials is under a lot of investigation - that is, solid porous sorbents which are not plagued by high regeneration costs or degradation. These include \acrshortpl{mof},\citep{Ding2019Carbon, qian2020mof} zeolites,\citep{Siriwardane2005Adsorption, Krishna2010silico} and of course porous carbons.\citep{Zhu2015Naturally, Chen2019Template, Xia2011Superior, Sevilla2016Highly} 

Candidates for solid \glspl{adsorbent} applied to \ce{CO2} capture are typically exploited for swing adsorption processes such as \acrfull{psa}, \acrfull{vsa} or \acrfull{tsa}. This type of process relies on \gls{adsorption} taking place at some pressure (\acrshort{psa}, \acrshort{vsa}) or temperature (\acrshort{tsa}) after which \ce{CO2} can be regenerated by changing the condition; typically this means reducing the pressure or increasing the temperature to facilitate desorption.\citep{bahamon2018energetic, hedin2013adsorbents, Zhao2018Synthesis, adewole2013current, ho2008reducing}  \acrshort{psa} and \acrshort{vsa} only differ in that the former captures \ce{CO2} at elevated pressure and regenerates by reducing to ambient pressure; whereas the latter performs capture at ambient pressure and release occurs at vaccuum. Thus \acrshort{vsa} is more cost effective, however both of these pressure-based solutions are more desirable than \acrshort{tsa} as they can be performed at the elevated temperatures present in flue gases.\citep{ho2008reducing, adewole2013current, Pirngruber2013} Due to the different physical conditions used to capture and regenerate \ce{CO2} in each of these adsorptive processes, selection of solid sorbent is based on porosity. For example, materials for \acrshort{psa} should have a high specific surface area and possess minimal microprosity while for \acrshort{vsa} pore size is more important than overall surface area (see \ref{pub:review}, \textbf{figure 3.}).\citep{ho2008reducing, Chou2004, Presser2011Effect} Physisorbents such as \acrshortpl{mof} and zeolites have also been recently applied to the newer field of \acrfull{dac}, which may prove a necessary, complementary technology to post-combustion capture.\citep{kumar2015direct, mcqueen2021review, deutz2021life} Selectivity for \ce{CO2} over \ce{N2} is particularly important in \acrshort{dac} due to \ce{CO2}'s low partial pressure in the air. The selectivity is usually facilitated \textit{via} moieties with high chemical affinity for \ce{CO2}, but nonetheless porosity is likely to play a role in the performance of these materials.\citep{kumar2015direct, darunte2016direct, deng2021comparative}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The relationship between porosity and CO2 uptake}{The relationship between porosity and \ce{CO2} uptake}}

While surface chemistry may play a role in small molecule \gls{adsorption},\citep{Lueking2004, Li2011a, Li2020Sustainable, wang2012significantly, Botome2017Preparation, liang2013, Kayal2018Activated} in the case of \glspl{turbostratic carbon}, porosity is the defining variable for gas uptake performance\citep{Sevilla2014Energy, Adeniran2016Is, Sevilla2013Assessment, Choi2019Unique, Lee2013Determination, Presser2011Effect, Wickramaratne2013Importance} - see \ref{pub:review}, \textbf{section 3}. While increases in overall surface area and pore volume do improve gas uptake,\citep{Cox2017Ultra, Blankenship2017Cigarette} the effects of these parameters are limited by pore size\citep{Sevilla2014Energy, Sevilla2013Assessment} \citep{Choi2019Unique, Li2019Selective, Cabria2007optimum, Gogotsi2009, Masika2012} - that is, it is important to maximise the porosity of pores with some width in order to optimise gas uptake. This so-called optimum pore width is dependent not only on the targeted sorptive,\citep{Presser2011Effect, Biloe2002Optimal, Cabria2007optimum} but on the surface chemistry\citep{wang2012significantly, Kayal2018Activated, Lueking2004} and pore geometry\citep{Rzepka1998Physisorption, Zhou2004comparative, Hlushak2018Heat} of the \gls{adsorbent}. With all of these factors controlled for, at a given temperature, optimum pore size also appears to be highly variable with pressure.\citep{Presser2011Effect, DelaCasaLillo2002Hydrogen} Up to now, the optimum pore width is defined either as (i) a single pore width\citep{Sevilla2014Energy, Choi2019Unique, Li2019Selective} or (ii) all pores of width less than some maximum.\citep{Biloe2002Optimal, Cabria2007optimum, Presser2011Effect} These values for both (i) and (ii) are estimated through computational modelling,\citep{Biloe2002Optimal, Cabria2007optimum, Hlushak2018Heat} and then attempts are made to confirm these results through experiment.\citep{Choi2019Unique, Presser2011Effect}
