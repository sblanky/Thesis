\paragraph{Terminology:} The plethora of porous carbon materials are referred to by various terms in the literature. The focus of this work are \glspl{turbostratic carbon}, which are defined as possessing some regions of graphitic ordering, but are not ordered on the large scale. Within this group are \glspl{activated carbon} and \glspl{biochar} which are distinguished only by the former having a \gls{porogen} added in their synthesis in order to aid pore formation. Because many carbons in this work may be considered to lay at the boundary of these two materials, in general the term \gls{turbostratic carbon} is used. Occasionally, the terms \gls{biochar} or \gls{activated carbon} may appear in the text to explicitly distinguish two materials or sets thereof derived without and with a \gls{porogen}.
