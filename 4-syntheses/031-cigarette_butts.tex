\subsubsection{Sample composition}
A primary goal of synthesising the carbons from cigarette butts was quantification and identification of so-called contaminant-porogens in cigarette butts, and monitoring their presence upon conversion of cigarette butts to hydrochar then to turbostratic carbon. Initial identification and rough quantification of the contaminants was performed using P-XRD and TGA respectively, with reference to CHN elemental microanalysis. Attempts were made to identify and more precisely quantify components using XPS and ICP-OES. Finally, imaging of the dispersion of contaminant-metals within unwashed turbostratic carbons was performed using BSE-SEM and EDX-TEM.
