\section{Introduction}

The reported porosity of carbons derived from UCBs is highly varied depending on synthetic conditions. In the absence of an activating agent, and without pre-carbonisation steps, $A_{BET}$ typically does not exceed 700 $\rm m^2\ g^{-1}$.\citep{Koochaki2019, Soltani2013, Yazdi2012, Lee2014, Hamzah2017} Whereas using a porogen, and/or pre-carbonising in air or hydothermally can improve surface areas to around 3000 $\rm m^2\ g^{-1}$.\citep{xiong2018, Koochaki2019, Sun2017, Bilge2019} The author's reports of ultrahigh porosity from KOH-activated hydrothermally carbonised UCBs in Publication VI ($A_{BET}\ \rm >\ 4000\ m^2\ g^{-1} $, pore volume $\rm > 2.00\ cm^3\ g^{-1}$) and microporosity ($\rm > 90\ \%$) are partially corroborated by the similar results using pure cellulose acetate (CA) in Publication V, suggesting that CA is an ideal candidate for activation to high surface area carbons. Xiong et al also report a nitrogen-doped UCB-derived activated carbon with hierarchical porosity and $A_{BET}$ of 3420 $\rm m^2\ g^{-1}$, though this result is dubious as (i) the \ce{N2} isotherm does not include ultralow pressure data, (ii) freespace appears to be incorrectly measured and (iii) isotherm measurement is not described in the text.\citep{xiong2019nitrogen} It was suggested in Publication VI that the unusually high porosity may be contributed to by the action of so-called contaminant-porogens, i.e. trace elements in found in cigarette butts that can act as activating agents because carbons from UCBs had greater porosity than unused, i.e. 'fresh' CBs. However, another factor may be the specific treatment of the UCBs prior to any carbonisation - that is the removal of any paper, residual ash and tobacco.

The trace element composition of UCBs have been studied by various means, including neutron activation analysis of the intact butts,\citep{iskander1992multielement, Iskander1985, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997} adsorption and emission spectroscopy of various aqueous extracts,\citep{MussaloRauhamaa1986, Kazi2009, Moriwaki2009, Moerman2011, Pelit2013, Dobaradaran2018} voltammetry experiments,\citep{Nitsch1991, Kalcher1993} as well as mixed methods according to environmental contaminant quantification standards.\citep{cardoso2018exposure} The reported concentration has a great degree of variability depending on collection site, method, and brand. For example, work by Iskander et al indicates that \ce{Al} can be present in concentrations as low as 59, and as high as 2200 $\rm{\mu g\ g^{-1}}$, depending on the country of origin of the smoked cigarette butt. Similarly, UCB samples collected from the environment\citep{Dobaradaran2017, Moriwaki2009, Moerman2011, chevalier2018nano} may reduce in quantities of some elements due to leaching, but similarly may absorb some elements from the environment (for example from sea water). Trace elements have been identified in cigarette butts from almost every region of the periodic table, including alkali and alkaline earth metals;\cite{MussaloRauhamaa1986, Iskander1985, iskander1992multielement, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997, cardoso2018exposure}  transition metals, post transition metals and metalloids;\citep{MussaloRauhamaa1986, Dobaradaran2017, Iskander1985, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997, Moriwaki2009, Moerman2011, Pelit2013, Dobaradaran2018, Ren2017, cardoso2018exposure, chevalier2018nano} lanthanides;\citep{iskander1992multielement} and halogens.\citep{Iskander1985, iskander1992multielement, jenkins1985neutron, Wu1997} Cigarette butt derived carbons have been also been found to contain various metals in trace quantities,\citep{Soltani, Soltani2013, Yazdi2012} although \ce{Ti}, \ce{K}, and \ce{Na} have also been reported at quantities above 1 wt.\%.\citep{Soltani, Soltani2013, Yazdi2012, Lima2018}

\section{Precursor selection, synthesis \& sample designation}
% may need to include more synthetic details depending on methodology section.

The genesis of this synthetic work is linked to results reported in Publication VI, namely the unusually high surface area and microporosity ($ \rm > 4000\ m^2\ g^{-1}$ and $\rm > 90\ \%$ respectively) found for samples derived from the KOH-activation of used cigarette filter derived hydrochar. It was suggested in this report that this porosity was not solely a result of KOH but indeed that other porogens (so-called contaminant-porogens) may be present in the precursor. This made it important to (i) determine the identity of these  contaminant-porogens; (ii) test whether these high levels of (micro-) porosity could be attained using the whole cigarette butt; (iii) ascertain if the removal of these contaminant-porogens had an effect on porosity; and (iv) see if such contaminant-porogens do in fact confer porosity on their own. As a result, samples were synthesised both from public ash trays and from a single brand as well as with and without the wrapping paper. Full synthetic details can be found in table \ref{tb:cb_synthesis}. In all cases, used $\rm 2.5\ g$ cigarette butts (UCBs) were ground in a spice grinder, hydrothermally carbonised with $\rm 25\ cm^3$ water at $250\ ^{\circ}C$ ($\rm 5\ ^{\circ}C\ min^{-1}$), held $\rm 2\ h$ then activated for with or without KOH. After cooling, all samples were washed with HCl for at least $\rm 24\ h$, then filtered and washed with water to give neutral washings. Sample designation is h\textit{A-xTTT}, where \textit{A} is the sample prefix (see table \ref{tb:cb_synthesis}), \textit{x} is KOH:cigarette ratio (wt./wt.), and \textit{TTT} is activation temperature in $^{\circ}C$. A portion of each self activated (i.e. $x = 0$) sample in sets $C$ and $D$ was left unwashed to determine the efficacy of the final washing step. These are indicated with $'$, for example hC-0800$'$ indicates a sample activated at $\rm 800\ ^{\circ}C$ in the absence of activating agent, which was not washed. To refer to the hydrochar itself, the designation is hA-hydrochar, e.g. hydrochar derived from subset h\textit{D} (see table \ref{tb:cb_synthesis}) is hD-hydrochar.

% need comparison to other hydrochars and carbons
Yields of hydrochars and derived turbostratic carbons can be found in table \ref{tb:cb_yield} (refer to table \ref{tb:cb_synthesis} for information on the three sets of carbons). The fact that the yield of hC-hydrochar is significantly less than that of hD-hydrochar indicates that washing the hydrochar does remove some labile matter. Although hE-hydrochar was also not washed, it has a similar yield to hC-hydrochar perhaps indicating that the concentration of non-carbonisable material was lower in set E of cigarette butts. These differences in yield are also transferred to the overall yield (bracketed numbers) of derived turbostratic carbons, but not to the yield of the single step, indicating that whatever is removed by washing of the hydrochar does not have a significant affect on the product of the pyrolysis step. It is noteworthy that the yields of washed and unwashed carbons (0600 and 0600$'$, respectively) are very similar, indicating that the extensive washing step does not remove significant amounts of material. Yields of \ce{KOH}-activated samples are of course significantly lower than samples pyrolysed in the absence of external activating agent, due to removal of \ce{K2CO3} from the carbon framework during washing.


\subsection{Sample composition}

A primary goal of synthesising the carbons from cigarette butts was quantification and identification of so-called contaminant-porogens in cigarette butts, and monitoring their presence upon conversion of cigarette butts to hydrochar then to turbostratic carbon. Initial identification and rough quantification of the contaminants was performed using P-XRD and TGA respectively, with reference to CHN elemental microanalysis. Attempts were made to identify and more precisely quantify components using XPS and ICP-OES. Finally, imaging of the dispersion of contaminant-metals within unwashed turbostratic carbons was performed using BSE-SEM and EDX-TEM.

Relative proportions (by weight) of \ce{C}, \ce{H}, and \ce{N} for all UCB-derived samples, as well as their ash content can be found in table \ref{tb:chn_ash}. The composition of hydrochars and carbons activated without \ce{KOH}, is essentially the same for samples in sets hC and hD. Furthermore the discrepancy in the ash content of hC-hydrochar and hD-hydrochar is within margin for error. As such, it can be confirmed that the post-hydrothermal carbonisation washing step only serves to remove combustible matter, i.e. non-metals. The slightly larger discrepancies in ash content between samples hC-0\textit{TTT} and hD-0\textit{TTT} (or hC-0\textit{TTT}$'$ and hD-0\textit{TTT}$'$) must therefore be ascribed to heterogeneous distribution of contaminants in the precursor, as opposed to removal of non-combustible contaminants prior to pyrolysis. Furthermore, washing of the turbostratic carbons does not seem to serve any consistent, significant role  in removing these contaminants. On the other hand, \ce{KOH}-activated samples (i.e. hC-4\textit{TTT} and hD-4\textit{TTT}) show more significant compositional differences, particularly in terms of \ce{C} content. This further confirms that the reduction in yield of hD-hydrochar relative to hC-hydrochar (see table \ref{tb:cb_yield}) is a result of removal of water-souble organic material not incorporated into the hydrochar macrostructure; it appears that the \ce{KOH} destroys such material in hD-4\textit{TTT}, thus reducing \ce{C} content. The higher C and lower ash content of hE-hydrochar and hE-0\textit{TTT} samples is an indication that the majority of the non-combustible contaminants seen in the ash of hC and hD samples come from the UCB wrapping paper as opposed to the UCB itself. In fact, the ash content is within margin for error for these samples, and as a result the composition of these samples is much easier to discern; the 'other' column represents the \ce{O} content. Unsurprisingly, \ce{C} content increases, and \ce{O} content decreases with increasing activation temperature as consistently reported elsewhere.\citep{Blankenship2022Modulating, Sevilla2014Energy}

%remember to make and refer to appendices
P-XRD confirms the presence of crystalline material in most of the hydrochar and turbostratic carbon samples (see appendix). Due to the complexity of the spectra it is difficult to assign peaks to any particular specie. Using XPS it was possible to identify \ce{Ti}, \ce{Na}, \ce{K}, and \ce{Ca} in dry-ashed UCBs (see appendix). although absolute concentrations are not determinable by this technique as (i) there are likely adventitious \ce{C} and \ce{O} atoms on the surface of the ash, and (ii) it is unlikely that all atomic species are accounted for. ICP-OES allowed more precise determinations of metals in UCBs, their wrapping paper, and a derived hydrochar - results are shown in table \ref{tb:icp}. These results confirm the presence of metals identified in XPS, as well as identifying \ce{Al}, \ce{Fe}, and \ce{Mg} in all samples. \ce{Zn} was only found in quantifiable amounts for the UCB wrapping paper. These metals have previously been identified in UCBs by Iskander and others.\citep{chevalier2018nano, cardoso2018exposure, iskander1992multielement, jenkins1985neutron} All trace elements were found to have a higher occurence in the paper as opposed to the whole UCB. This may explain the much higher ash content of hydrochars and turbostratic carbons derived from whole UCBs as compared to unwrapped UCBs, i.e. hC/hD  samples versus those derived from hE and those reported in Publication VI respectively.
