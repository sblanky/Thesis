\subsubsection*{The author's contribution to these publications;}

In all cases, the author wrote the manuscript. For Publication I the author performed the literature review. In the case of Publication II the author did all experimental work and conceptualised the project and performed the majority of data analysis. For Publication III the author contributed to experimental work, conceptualised and designed the software needed to perform the analyses, and performed all data analysis.

In addition to this thesis, the author has contributed to this publication;
